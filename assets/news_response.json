    "title": "Djokovic equals Grand Slam record with Australian Open title win",
    "description": "Novak Djokovic won a record-equaling 22nd Grand Slam title as he defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets in the Australian Open final on Sunday. At the same time, Djokovic extended his record number of titles in Melbourne with a 10th triumph at the tournament.\n\nAfter surging out of the blocks to take the first set at Rod Laver Arena, Djokovic was made to work by third seed Tsitsipas in the second and third sets. But the Serb applied his hallmark intensity to break the resistance from his Greek rival, winning 6-3 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-5) in a contest lasting two hours and 56 minutes.\n\nWith the title, Djokovic moves level with Spanish great Rafael Nadal on 22 Grand Slams at the pinnacle of the men’s all-time list. After Nadal’s latest injury woes in Australia and Djokovic’s own imperious march to yet another title, many will tip the Serb to move out on his own at the top of those standings – even with Nadal’s favored French Open next up on the Grand Slam calendar.

    "description": "The Australian Open runs to its conclusion this weekend, with the first Grand Slam of 2023 set to be bookended on Sunday when the men’s championship match is played between record nine-time winner Novak Djokovic and debut finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas.\n\nWith the exit of Karen Khachanov in the semifinals at the hands of Tsitsipas, Russia is again left ruing a missed opportunity for glory in Melbourne after Daniil Medvedev was beaten in successive finals in the past two editions of the tournament.\n\nIndeed, it is fast approaching two decades since the last Russian man won the title Down Under. On that occasion it was Marat Safin, one of the most charismatic, combustible characters of his or any other generation of tennis talent. The second Russian to win the Australian Open after Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999, Safin struck gold in 2005 in Melbourne by coming back to beat local favorite Lleyton Hewitt in what was his last great individual triumph.",

Both he and NBA commissioner Adam Silver walked onto the court to congratulate the 38-year-old James.\n\n“To be able to be in the presence of such a legend as great as Kareem, it’s very humbling. Please give a standing ovation to the Captain, please,” James said as he paid tribute to Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nJames thanked his family and fans for allowing him to “be a part of something I’ve always dreamed about.”",

But Sabalenka gradually exerted her own big-hitting game and leveled the match by taking the second set 6-3.\n\nBoth players continued to produce some dazzling shot-making at Rod Laver Arena in a battle befitting the occasion. It was Sabalenka who made the crucial move by breaking Rybakina’s serve in game seven of the decisive set. Despite a wobble as she saw three match points slip away, Sabalenka held her never to serve out the final set 6-4 and take the title with it.",

    "description": "Former world heavyweight champion boxer George Foreman, 74, has filed counter legal proceedings against a woman who has accused him of sexual abuse more than 40 years ago, when she was a minor.\n\nForeman, who fought Muhammad Ali in the most famous boxing match in history – The Rumble in the Jungle – is alleging that he is being targeted in an extortion attempt, in a statement released last summer, referring to accusations that he'd sexually abused two women in the 1970s as “baseless threats and lies.”\n\nOn Monday, the ex-boxer filed a counter lawsuit against one of the women, known only as Gwen H., who had alleged that she was groomed and eventually abused by Foreman while she was underage.\n\nIn legal documents seen by TMZ Sports, Foreman’s legal team are said to be aware that they are powerless to sue the woman over the allegations in her own lawsuit but state that he is now entitled to pursue legal proceedings due to a news conference held by the alleged victim three months after she initially filed her claim.\n\nForeman’s countersuit says that the allegations made against him are “entirely fabricated” and that there is “zero corroborating evidence in the form of documents, photographs, letters, or witnesses to support ... false claims against Foreman.”",

Musk appeared to back Provorov after he faced calls to be expelled from the US.\n\n“The pendulum has swung a bit too far,” tweeted Musk on Friday, replying to a clip in which NHL analyst EJ Hradek suggested that if Provorov doesn’t support liberal US values, he should return to Russia to take part in the military campaign in Ukraine.\n\n“The gay movement, in about 7 years, went from ‘equal rights’ to ‘go f***ing die in a trench war if you don’t wear a pride shirt!’” read the original post from Twitter user Maxwell Meyer to which Musk replied, and which shared the clip of Hradek criticizing Provorov.Provorov, who is Russian Orthodox, later explained that he “respects everybody’s choices” but decided not to take part because he wanted to “stay true to myself and my religion.”\n\nThe player, 26, has been defended by Flyers coach John Tortorella, who argued on Thursday that Provorov has “done nothing wrong.” Speaking to journalists, Tortorella said: “Just because you don’t agree with his decision, it doesn’t mean he did anything wrong.”",

    "description": "Juventus have been handed a 15-point deduction by the Italian football authorities following an investigation into allegations of financial irregularities. The Turin club has already said it will appeal the punishment.\n\nIn immediate terms, the points deduction means Juventus have plunged from third to tenth place in the Serie A table. They are now 25 points behind league leaders Napoli – who beat them 5-1 earlier this month – and are 12 points adrift of the European qualification spots.\n\nThe Italian football federation (FIGC) announced its decision on Friday, and the sanction is even harsher than the nine-point deduction that prosecutors had been seeking in the case. It was announced that former Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli – who resigned along with other members of the board in November – has been banned from holding a position in Italian football for two years.\n\nJuventus’ former vice-president Pavel Nedved has been hit with an eight-month ban, while ex-sporting director Fabio Paratici – who now works at English Premier League team Tottenham Hotspur – has been banned for 30 months. The London club is trying to ascertain if the sanctions will influence Paratici’s position, with the FIGC reportedly requesting that the punishment be applied across all UEFA and FIFA jurisdiction.  \n\nJuventus and former club officials have denied any wrongdoing and have already announced their intention to appeal the decision at the country’s highest sports court within the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI).",

Navas came out to deal with a cross but ended up missing the ball and elbowing Ronaldo in the face, leaving the striker in a heap on the floor.\n\nThe incident saw the Saudi All-Stars awarded a penalty, which Ronaldo tucked away to level the game at 1-1. The 37-year-old was left with red marks and bruising, which were inspected more closely by PSG forward Mbappe.",
